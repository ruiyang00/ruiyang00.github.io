Iâ€™m a 4th-year PhD candidate at the University of Virginia. The primary aim of my research is to design practical, efficient, and user-friendly infrastructure systems that support data-hungry applications. My research interests lie in distributed systems and storage systems, with a current focus on uncovering the new potentials when the system invlves large scale processing, machine learning and storage. Specifically, I am working on (1) **ML4Sotrage**: improving existing storage and database systems through learned approaches; and (2) **Sys4ML**: designing better compute and storage systems for large sacle ML applications.
